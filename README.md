# NFL American Football Repo
## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Data in providing insights into the world of American Football/the NFL.
The use of data in the NFL is not a previously untouched area, however here I hope to apply Data Analytics and Data Science to:
* Overall game outcomes
* The performance of players over the season/their careers, and at the game level
* The outcome of plays or the game based on events within the game

Current progress:
1) Currently developing the data and insights for this season and for historic games
	a) Developed notebook to collect the outcome of every NFL game in NFL history (1920s-present)
	b) Developed notebook to undertake processing of the above game data for use in analytics
	c) Developed a class to undertake ELO performance scoring and a notebook to make use of the class and score all games
	d) Developed a notebook to undertake comprehensive analysis of Super Bowl game history
